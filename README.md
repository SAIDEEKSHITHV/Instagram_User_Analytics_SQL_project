# 📊 User Analytics on Instagram (SQL Project)

Use SQL to examine Instagram user behavior and engagement trends in order to produce useful information for investor and marketing decisions.

## Project Overview 🧠

In order to identify patterns in user growth, engagement, and post performance, this project uses **MySQL Workbench** to delve into an Instagram-style dataset. Simulating how real-world companies or data teams might use SQL analytics to propel strategy and expansion is the aim.

## Goals 🔍

Examine follower growth patterns over time; find high-performing content based on engagement rate; monitor user activity (posts, likes, comments); identify influential people with a significant following; and offer data-supported suggestions to stakeholders and marketers.

## Technology & Tools 🛠

**SQL** – MySQL Workbench - **Data Visualization** – (optional, based on Excel/Tableau) - **PDF Report** – Provides a summary of conclusions and suggestions
